## Project Overview

As a primary excavator operator at PT. Nadesico Nickel Industry, I have been responsible for managing critical excavation and loading operations in nickel mining activities since 2023. This role demands high precision, safety consciousness, and operational efficiency in a challenging mining environment.

## Key Responsibilities

### Daily Operations
- Operating PC200 excavator for nickel ore excavation and loading operations
- Achieving daily production targets of 800-1000 BCM (Bank Cubic Meters)
- Coordinating with dump truck operators for efficient material transfer
- Maintaining operational efficiency above 90% through systematic work planning

### Safety & Compliance
- Conducting comprehensive daily pre-operation checks (P2H) before every shift
- Ensuring 100% compliance with K3 (Occupational Safety & Health) standards
- Implementing hazard identification and risk assessment procedures
- Maintaining zero accident record throughout employment period

### Equipment Management
- Performing routine maintenance checks and basic troubleshooting
- Monitoring hydraulic system performance and fuel consumption
- Reporting equipment issues promptly to maintenance team
- Ensuring equipment cleanliness and proper storage

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Variable Terrain Conditions
**Problem:** Mining site featured highly variable soil conditions, from soft clay to hard rock formations, affecting productivity and equipment strain.

**Solution:** 
- Adapted operating techniques based on material type
- Adjusted bucket penetration angles for optimal digging force
- Coordinated with geology team for material assessment
- Reduced equipment strain by 30% through proper technique

### Challenge 2: Production Target Pressure
**Problem:** Meeting aggressive daily production targets while maintaining safety standards and equipment longevity.

**Solution:**
- Implemented systematic work pattern optimization
- Reduced cycle time by improving loading position
- Enhanced coordination with truck fleet for minimal idle time
- Achieved 95% target completion rate with zero safety incidents

### Challenge 3: Extreme Weather Operations
**Problem:** Operating during heavy rainfall and high humidity affecting visibility and site conditions.

**Solution:**
- Developed enhanced safety protocols for adverse weather
- Improved communication system with ground crew
- Adjusted operating speed based on visibility conditions
- Maintained operational continuity with zero weather-related incidents

## Results & Impact

### Operational Performance
- **Productivity:** Consistently achieved 95-98% of daily production targets
- **Efficiency:** Maintained 92% operational efficiency rate
- **Fuel Economy:** Optimized fuel consumption by 15% through proper technique
- **Equipment Uptime:** Contributed to 96% equipment availability through proactive P2H

### Safety Record
- **Zero Accidents:** Maintained perfect safety record throughout tenure
- **100% P2H Compliance:** Never missed daily pre-operation checks
- **Safety Initiatives:** Proposed and implemented 3 safety improvement measures
- **Near-Miss Reporting:** Actively contributed to incident prevention program

### Team Contribution
- Mentored 2 junior operators in proper excavation techniques
- Shared best practices in weekly safety meetings
- Collaborated with maintenance team for equipment optimization
- Received "Best Operator of the Quarter" recognition (Q2 2024)

## Technical Specifications

### Equipment Operated
- **Primary:** Komatsu PC200-8M1 (20-ton class)
- **Secondary:** Hitachi ZX200 (Similar class)
- **Attachment:** Standard bucket (1.0 m³), rock bucket (0.8 m³)

### Operation Parameters
- **Daily Production:** 800-1,000 BCM
- **Cycle Time:** 28-32 seconds average
- **Operating Hours:** 8-10 hours per shift
- **Fuel Consumption:** 18-22 liters/hour

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Technical Proficiency:** Expert-level excavator operation in mining environment
- **Safety Management:** Comprehensive K3 implementation and compliance
- **Problem Solving:** Adaptive solutions for challenging terrain and conditions
- **Team Coordination:** Effective communication with operators and ground crew
- **Maintenance Awareness:** Proactive equipment care and issue identification
- **Productivity Focus:** Consistent achievement of production targets

## Lessons Learned

This project reinforced the critical importance of balancing productivity with safety. The most successful operations are those where systematic preparation (P2H) and continuous vigilance create a foundation for both efficiency and safety. Proper communication with team members and adaptive operating techniques are essential for handling the dynamic challenges of mining operations.

## Future Applications

The experience and techniques developed in this role are directly applicable to various heavy earthmoving projects, including:
- Large-scale construction site development
- Infrastructure projects (roads, dams, ports)
- Quarrying and aggregate production
- Land reclamation and site preparation
- Environmental rehabilitation projects
