When I joined my current mining operation, the excavator productivity was averaging around 650 BCM (Bank Cubic Meters) per day. Within 6 months of implementing systematic technique optimization, we achieved consistent output of 800+ BCM daily - a **23% increase in productivity**.

Here's exactly how I did it, and how you can apply these techniques too.

## The Challenge

**Initial Situation:**
- Average daily production: 650 BCM
- Fuel consumption: 180 liters/day
- Cycle time: 28-32 seconds
- Downtime: 12% per shift
- Team morale: Low (pressure to meet targets)

**Target Goals:**
- Increase production to 800+ BCM/day
- Reduce fuel consumption per BCM
- Maintain safety standards
- Improve operator satisfaction

## The 5-Step Optimization Process

### Step 1: Data Collection and Baseline Analysis

**Duration:** 2 weeks  
**Tools:** Logbook, stopwatch, fuel tracking

I started by collecting detailed data on:

- **Cycle times:** Measured 100 complete cycles
  - Dig: 8-10 seconds
  - Swing loaded: 6-8 seconds
  - Dump: 3-4 seconds
  - Swing empty: 5-7 seconds
  - **Total:** 28-32 seconds average

- **Fuel consumption patterns:**
  - Idle time: 45 minutes/shift (wasted fuel)
  - Peak consumption: During deep digging
  - Lowest efficiency: Morning start (cold engine)

- **Downtime analysis:**
  - Truck waiting: 35% of downtime
  - Position changes: 25%
  - Maintenance/fuel: 20%
  - Breaks: 20%

> **Key Insight:** Data showed we were losing 1.5 hours of productive time per shift due to poor coordination and unnecessary idle time.

### Step 2: Technique Refinement

**Duration:** 4 weeks  
**Focus:** Optimizing each phase of the dig-swing-dump cycle

#### Digging Technique Optimization

**Before:** Full bucket curl at bottom, then lift
**After:** Progressive curl during lift (saves 2-3 seconds)

**Specific improvements:**
1. **Entry angle:** Reduced from 35° to 30° - cleaner material entry
2. **Bucket positioning:** Start curl at 60% depth, complete at surface
3. **Tooth engagement:** Keep teeth perpendicular to bench face
4. **Stick extension:** Use full stick length for maximum reach

**Result:** Reduced dig time from 9s to 7s average

#### Swing Optimization

**Before:** Full swing arc, no consideration for momentum
**After:** Optimized swing path with momentum management

**Key changes:**
1. **Minimize swing angle:** Position truck for shortest swing (reduced from 110° to 85°)
2. **Use momentum:** Begin swing as bucket breaks surface
3. **Counter-rotation:** Start return swing before dump completes
4. **Eye coordination:** Look at dump point during loaded swing

**Result:** Reduced swing time from 7s to 5.5s average

#### Dump Optimization

**Before:** Complete stop, then dump
**After:** Dump initiated during swing deceleration

**Improvements:**
1. **Timing:** Begin bucket release 1 second before swing stops
2. **Height control:** Maintain consistent 1.5m dump height
3. **Clean dump:** Quick shake to clear material
4. **Return speed:** Fast return to dig position

**Result:** Reduced dump cycle from 4s to 2.5s average

### Step 3: Work Area Setup

**Duration:** 1 week  
**Impact:** High efficiency gain

#### Bench Organization

Created systematic work zones:

```
Zone 1: Primary dig area (70% of production)
Zone 2: Secondary dig area (20% of production)
Zone 3: Cleanup/repositioning (10%)
```

**Setup routine:**
1. Clear working platform (5 minutes at shift start)
2. Position truck loading point (minimize swing)
3. Establish escape route (safety requirement)
4. Remove obstacles within swing radius

#### Truck Positioning System

**Before:** Trucks positioned randomly
**After:** Marked positions with optimal swing angles

**System:**
- Position 1: 85° swing (primary - 70% of loads)
- Position 2: 100° swing (secondary - 25% of loads)
- Position 3: 120° swing (cleanup - 5% of loads)

**Result:** Reduced average swing by 15°, saving 1.5s per cycle

### Step 4: Fuel Efficiency Integration

**Duration:** 2 weeks  
**Target:** Reduce fuel consumption while increasing output

#### Engine Management

**Idle Reduction:**
- Reduced idle RPM from 1200 to 900 (manufacturer spec)
- Shut down engine during breaks > 5 minutes
- Warm-up optimization: 3 minutes vs. previous 8 minutes

**RPM Optimization:**
- Normal digging: 1600-1800 RPM (vs. previous 2000+)
- Light material: 1400-1600 RPM
- Heavy digging: 1800-2000 RPM (only when needed)

**Result:** 18% fuel reduction per BCM

#### Hydraulic Efficiency

1. **Smooth controls:** Gradual acceleration/deceleration
2. **Pressure management:** Avoid over-pressuring system
3. **Combined functions:** Dig + lift simultaneously
4. **Regenerative circuits:** Use gravity during lowering

### Step 5: Team Coordination

**Duration:** Ongoing  
**Critical for success**

#### Communication Protocol

Established clear signals with truck drivers:

- **Hand signals:** When radio fails
- **Pre-shift briefing:** Daily 5-minute coordination
- **Problem reporting:** Immediate communication of issues
- **Efficiency feedback:** Weekly performance review

#### Truck Cycle Coordination

**Before:** Trucks arrived randomly
**After:** Timed 4-truck rotation system

**System:**
- Truck 1 loads while Truck 4 dumps
- Truck 2 positions while Truck 1 loads
- Truck 3 returns while Truck 2 positions
- Continuous cycle - zero waiting time

**Result:** Eliminated 35% of previous downtime

## The Results

### Productivity Gains

**Daily Production:**
- Before: 650 BCM/day
- After: 800-850 BCM/day
- **Increase: 23-31%**

**Cycle Time:**
- Before: 28-32 seconds
- After: 22-24 seconds
- **Improvement: 25%**

**Efficiency:**
- Before: 88% (12% downtime)
- After: 95% (5% downtime)
- **Improvement: 7 percentage points**

### Cost Savings

**Fuel Consumption:**
- Before: 180 liters/day (0.277 L/BCM)
- After: 165 liters/day (0.206 L/BCM)
- **Savings: 18% per BCM**

**Annual Fuel Savings:**
- 15 liters/day × 300 working days = 4,500 liters/year
- At Rp 15,000/liter = **Rp 67,500,000/year saved**

**Increased Production Value:**
- 150 BCM/day × 300 days = 45,000 BCM/year extra
- Revenue impact: **Significant contribution to company targets**

### Safety Improvements

- **Zero incidents** during and after optimization
- Reduced operator fatigue (smoother operation)
- Better equipment condition (less stress on components)
- Improved team morale

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Data-Driven Approach

Don't guess - measure everything:
- Baseline your current performance
- Track improvements systematically
- Document results for credibility

### 2. Small Changes, Big Impact

You don't need new equipment:
- Technique refinement: 7 seconds saved per cycle
- Work area setup: 1.5 seconds saved on swing
- Coordination: Eliminated 35% downtime

**Total:** 23% productivity increase with same equipment!

### 3. Sustainability Matters

Productivity shouldn't sacrifice:
- ✅ Safety (maintained zero incidents)
- ✅ Equipment life (reduced stress)
- ✅ Fuel efficiency (18% improvement)
- ✅ Operator wellbeing (less fatigue)

### 4. Team Coordination is Critical

Solo optimization has limits:
- Communication with truck drivers: Essential
- Pre-shift planning: Prevents delays
- Continuous feedback: Enables improvement
