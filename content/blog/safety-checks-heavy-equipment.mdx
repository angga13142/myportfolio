As a heavy equipment operator with years of experience in mining operations, I've learned that proper pre-operation checks can be the difference between a safe workday and a serious accident. Here are the 5 essential P2H (Pemeriksaan Pra-Penggunaan Harian / Pre-Operation Health) checks every operator must perform.

## 1. Visual Inspection Around the Equipment

**Time Required:** 3-5 minutes  
**Critical Level:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Before even entering the cabin, walk completely around your equipment:

- **Check for leaks:** Look under the machine for hydraulic fluid, engine oil, or coolant leaks
- **Inspect tracks/tires:** Look for damage, proper tension, and foreign objects
- **Examine attachments:** Ensure buckets, blades, or other tools are properly secured
- **Clear the area:** Remove any obstacles, rocks, or debris near the equipment

> **Pro Tip:** Always walk in the same direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) to build a consistent habit.

## 2. Fluid Levels Check

**Time Required:** 5-7 minutes  
**Critical Level:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Check all critical fluid levels:

### Engine Oil
- Check with engine cold or after 5 minutes of shutdown
- Oil level should be between MIN and MAX marks
- Look for color and consistency (dark/dirty oil needs changing)

### Hydraulic Oil
- Check reservoir level
- Look for milky appearance (water contamination)
- Ensure no foam or bubbles

### Coolant
- Check radiator level when engine is cold
- Inspect hoses for cracks or leaks
- Ensure proper coolant mixture

### Fuel
- Check fuel level gauge
- Inspect for water in fuel separator
- Drain water separator if necessary

## 3. Electrical System and Lights

**Time Required:** 3-4 minutes  
**Critical Level:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Safety depends on visibility and communication:

- **Battery:** Check terminals for corrosion, ensure tight connections
- **All lights:** Test headlights, work lights, brake lights, turn signals
- **Horn:** Ensure it works loudly and clearly
- **Backup alarm:** Critical for site safety - must be audible
- **Gauges:** Verify all dashboard indicators are functioning

## 4. Control Systems Test

**Time Required:** 5-8 minutes  
**Critical Level:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Start the engine and test all controls:

### Before Starting:
- Adjust seat to comfortable operating position
- Fasten seatbelt
- Adjust mirrors for full visibility
- Ensure all controls are in neutral

### After Starting:
- Let engine warm up for 3-5 minutes
- Check all gauges (oil pressure, temperature, fuel)
- Test all joysticks/levers for smooth operation
- Check brake pedal pressure
- Test parking brake
- Verify hydraulic system pressure

## 5. Safety Equipment and Emergency Systems

**Time Required:** 2-3 minutes  
**Critical Level:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Your last line of defense:

- **Fire extinguisher:** Present, charged, accessible
- **First aid kit:** Stocked and within reach
- **Emergency shutdown:** Test the emergency stop function
- **Communication device:** Radio or phone charged and working
- **PPE:** Hard hat, safety vest, safety glasses in cabin
- **Documentation:** Ensure logbook is current

## The Complete P2H Checklist

Here's a printable checklist you can laminate and keep in your cabin:

```
□ Visual walk-around inspection
□ Engine oil level and condition
□ Hydraulic oil level
□ Coolant level
□ Fuel level and water separator
□ Battery and electrical connections
□ All lights functional
□ Horn and backup alarm working
□ Seat and seatbelt adjusted
□ Mirrors adjusted
□ All gauges functioning
□ Control systems responsive
□ Brake system operational
□ Fire extinguisher present and charged
□ First aid kit stocked
□ Communication device working
□ Emergency shutdown tested
□ Logbook completed
```

## My Personal P2H Routine

After years of experience, here's my systematic approach:

1. **Morning arrival:** Review yesterday's issues from logbook
2. **5-minute walk:** Complete visual inspection
3. **Fluid check:** All levels checked and documented
4. **Cabin prep:** Adjust everything before starting engine
5. **Warm-up test:** Run through all systems during warm-up
6. **Documentation:** Complete P2H form before first operation
7. **Team brief:** Communicate with ground crew about the day's plan

## Why P2H Matters: A Real Story

Early in my career, I once skipped a thorough fluid check because I was running late. Within 2 hours of operation, my excavator's hydraulic system failed due to low oil levels I hadn't noticed. This resulted in:

- 4 hours of downtime
- Emergency repair costs
- Lost productivity (approximately 150 BCM)
- Potential safety hazard to nearby workers

**That day cost more than just money - it cost trust.** Since then, I've never compromised on P2H checks, no matter the time pressure.

## Common P2H Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rushing the process:** P2H takes 20-25 minutes - don't cut corners
2. **Skipping documentation:** If it's not documented, it wasn't done
3. **Ignoring small issues:** Small leaks become big problems
4. **Not reporting problems:** Always inform maintenance immediately
5. **Incomplete warm-up:** Cold hydraulic oil can damage systems

## Benefits of Proper P2H

From my experience across multiple mining sites:

- **96% equipment uptime** with consistent P2H
- **Zero major breakdowns** in 3 years at current site
- **40% reduction** in maintenance costs
- **Safer work environment** for entire team
- **Better equipment lifespan** - lasting 20%+ longer

## Conclusion

P2H checks aren't just company policy - they're your responsibility as a professional operator. These 20-25 minutes at the start of your shift can prevent hours of downtime, thousands in repair costs, and most importantly, keep you and your team safe.

Remember: **A safe operator is a professional operator.**
